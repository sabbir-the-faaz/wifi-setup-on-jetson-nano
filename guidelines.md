<p>First up we need to connect our network peripherals to the Jetson Nano. The WiFi adapter is a USB key, but we will need an Ethernet cable and of course our NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit as well as a 5V 4A power supply. If you are looking for these parts, our <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16308">DLI Course Kit for the Jetson Nano</a> is a great place to get all of the parts in one purchase! But, we do sell all of the parts of the kit individually as well.</p>

<p>Before you get started plugging things in, we recommend as a best practice to disconnect your power supply to Jetson Nano Developer Kit while connecting any peripheral devices to it to prevent any potential damage to the Dev Kit or peripheral device.</p>

<p><br>
</p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/20200421_095846.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/20200421_095846.jpg" alt="Edimax Adapter and Jetson Nano"></a> </div>
<br><p></p>

<p>Unpackage the adapter from its box and insert it into one of the four USB 2.0 ports on your NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer kit. Your preference as to which port is up to you, but we recommend one of the bottom ports here as you will probably never remove this adapter and it will not block visibility or access to other USB ports in the future.</p>

<p><br>
</p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/20200421_100518.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/20200421_100518.jpg" alt="Edimax Adapter plugged in to USB port."></a> </div>
<br><p></p>

<p>Next, connect your Jetson to an open port on your router with your Ethernet cable. Now that everything is connected, you can power the board using the 5V 4Amp barrel jack power supply included with the DLI Course Kit.</p>

<p><br>

          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="os-update-and-upgrade">OS Update and Upgrade</h2>
        <p>The driver installation and setup for the Edimax N150 is pretty straightforward, but it does require some housekeeping before we can download and install it. If your Operating System is already up to date, go ahead and skip to "Driver Installation".</p>

<p>We will need to update and upgrade the Linux OS that is on the board before doing anything else and that is where the hardwired Ethernet connection we established in the previous section comes into play.</p>

<p>There are two ways to access your Jetson Nano once it is connected to your network via Ethernet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keyboard, Mouse and Monitor - Though clunky it is probably the easiest way to work with your Jetson Nano outside their Jupyter Notebooks USB access.</p></li>
<li><p>SSH into your Nano - Find your Nano on your network and SSH into its IP address. For more information on how to do this on a Jetson Nano please see this tutorial from jetsonhacks.com <a href="https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2019/08/21/jetson-nano-headless-setup/">here</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using the DLI Course image for the Jetson Nano the username and password will both be: <code>dlinano</code></p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note:</b> For the sake of this tutorial we will assume you will be using a keyboard, mouse and monitor but will still install everything via command line so if you are using SSH all commands should be the same. </div>

<p>Once you have established connection and are working on your Jetson Nano you will need to update your and upgrade your OS.</p>

<p>Open a terminal window and type the following: <code>sudo apt-get update</code>. The terminal should prompt you for your password. Type in: <code>dlinano</code> if you are using the DLI course image and hit <kbd>[Enter]</kbd> (If you have changed your password or your image uses a different password, enter that instead). This will update all of the updated package information for the version of Ubuntu running on the Jetson Nano. Your terminal should print out something similar to the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/1.png"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/1.png" alt="Terminal printout after retrieving OS update package information"></a> </div><p></p>

<p>Once the command line prompt is returned to you it is now time to upgrade your system. This will take a significant amount of time if this is the first time running this command. The OS will download all of the updated packages and install them for you, essentially getting everything up to date with where your image “should be”. To upgrade your system type the following: <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code>. The prompt will again ask for your password and will also ask for permission to install all of the packages. Type <code>y</code> and hit <kbd>[Enter]</kbd>.</p>

<p>Now you get to wait and watch the install process fly by on your screen. Or, play a game, respond to email or eat lunch as this will take some time.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> The update and upgrade processes can take a considerable amount of time. Patience is key and it is recommended that you do not walk away from your Nano for extended periods of time while this is happening. </div>

<p>Once your Jetson Nano has completed its upgrade (assuming you did not receive any errors during the process), reboot your Nano by typing the following: <code>sudo reboot now</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd>.</p>

<p>Your Nano will reboot itself. If you are using SSH you will need to reestablish a connection with the Nano (The IP address <strong>should</strong> still be the same)</p>      </div>
          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="driver-installation">Driver Installation</h2>
        <p>With your operating system up to date and after your NVIDIA Jetson Nano has rebooted, it is time to download and install the drivers for the Edimax N150 WiFi adapter. We will cover how to do that in detail in this section.</p>

<h3>Download the N150 Drivers</h3>

<p>You can download the appropriate drivers by opening a terminal and entering the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bu.git</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>Once the download is complete you can navigate into the drivers directory with the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>cd rtl8723bu</code> and then <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You are now in the the directory (folder) to start the install process for the drivers!</p>

<h3>Installing the Drivers</h3>

<p>There are a couple of methods to install these drivers on a single board computer or really any other Linux computer. You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bu/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> of the GitHub repository to compile and install them from scratch, but we are going to install them through Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS). These instructions can be found at the bottom of the README for the drivers, but we will reiterate them here.</p>

<p>Assuming you are still in the driver directory named “rtl8723bu” type the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>source dkms.conf</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>Once you get the command prompt back (which should almost be instantaneous) type the following command to create a working project directory:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo mkdir /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>With the directory created, type the following to move a number of files to your working project directory: <br></p>

<p><code>sudo cp -r core hal include os_dep platform dkms.conf Makefile rtl8723b_fw.bin /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>We finally add those files to DKMS with by executing the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo dkms add $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>Now that everything is ready and in its place we can finally install the drivers by typing the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo dkms autoinstall $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>DKMS will take a number of actions to install the drivers including cleaning up after itself and deleting unnecessary files and directories. Once the DKMS completes the installation you should get a positive confirmation of the installation!</p>

<p>With the installation complete it is a good idea to reboot your Nvidia Jetson Nano with this command:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo reboot now</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note:</b> If you are accessing your Nano via SSH you will still need your Ethernet connection for the next steps, but if you are using a keyboard and mouse with a monitor you may disconnect your Ethernet cable and put it away at this time!</div>      </div>
          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="connecting-to-your-network">Connecting to Your Network</h2>
        <p>Upon reboot of your system, you should now have WiFi connection available to you! Open a command prompt to verify a succefful driver installation by checking if you have a wireless network device installed. Open a terminal and type the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>ifconfig wlan0</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You should get a response similar to the screen capture below. Notice that we have two wlan connections... wlan0 and wlan1 with only one connected and an IP address assigned to it.</p>

<p><br>
</p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/2.png"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/2.png" alt="alt text"></a> </div>
<br><p></p>

<p>To set up your connection from the command prompt you can use the NetworkManager tool from Ubuntu as outlined here. First, we will list all of our possible network connections by typing the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>nmcli  d</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You should get a connection listing similar to something like this screen capture:</p>

<p><br>
</p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/4.png"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/4.png" alt="alt text"></a> </div>
<br><p></p>

<p>Next we will make sure that the WiFi module is turned on by typing the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>nmcli r wifi on</code><kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>Now we can scan and list off all visible WiFi networks available to us by typing the following command:
<br></p>

<p><code>nmcli d wifi list</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You should get a list of possible networks available to you including current status in terms of signal strength, data rate, channel, security, etc.</p>

<p><br>
</p><div class="center-block text-center"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/5.png"><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/7/7/5.png" alt="alt text"></a> </div>
<br><p></p>

<p>Make sure that you see the wireless network that you are going to connect to.</p>

<p>To connect to a given network make sure you have its SSID and password ready. Both are case sensitive! Type the following command with [SSID] being your SSID and [PASSWORD] being the password for that network:
<br></p>

<p><code>nmcli d wifi connect [SSID] password [PASSWORD]</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, you should get a connection confirmation!</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note:</b> If you are using SSH it is now your turn to untether yourself from the Ethernet cable and put it away. For future SSH connections make sure that your laptop or computer that you are accessing the Nano with over SSH is on the same wireless network that you just setup for your Nano in the previous steps. </div>

<h3>Testing Your Connection</h3>

<p>With your WiFi adapter connected to the internet you can now test it! Obviously in desktop mode with a keyboard and mouse you can open your browser and navigate to your favorite website.</p>

<p>If you are using SSH and able to connect SSH over WiFi and your laptop, you have also scored a win in terms of the WiFi adapter and its connection. Either way you can also test your Nano's connection and ability to access the internet with a simple ping command pointed at Google. Run the following command from the terminal on your Nano:
<br></p>

<p><code>ping 8.8.8.8</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You should get a response every few seconds reporting the data that comes back from the ping. You should be looking for packets both sent and received. If received packets is returned as 0, you do not have a connection established to the internet and should repeat the process of connecting above.</p>      </div>
          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you experience intermittent WiFi connection through this adapter open a terminal window and enter the following command to turn Power Saving Mode off:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save off</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>You may also have a second wireless device present when using the Edimax WiFi adapter. This will show up as wlan1. Repeat the command for wlan1 as well if the issue continues:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo iw dev wlan1 set power_save off</code><kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>Then reboot your Jetson Nano:
<br></p>

<p><code>sudo reboot now</code> <kbd>[Enter]</kbd></p>

<p>If you try this and a number of the Troubleshooting methods, try burning our <a href="https://static.sparkfun.com/large/sparkfun_jetbot_v01-00.zip">JetBot image</a> to your SD Card.
